Tech:
        - ZKP - Chaum-Pedersen
        - gRPC for communication (tonic)
    - UI - TBD
    - Database - TBD

Workflow:
    Server:
        1. Run the Server
        2. In the candidates.txt will be a list of candidates
        3. Data will be stored in database

    Client:
        1. ID validation (will not be covered)
            - We assume user has validated the ID
            - In response for validated ID user will get random key for registration access
            - NOTE: Random key is in no way connected to the ID , or any identity!!
            - Random key only purpose is to grant access to registration, so each individual can register only once
        2. Registration
            - User grants access to register when filling the random key they got from validator
            - Registration grants user with public_key and private_key
            - public and private keys need to be written by user by hand
        3. Login
            - Login will be loading a private key file (or config)
        4. Voting
            - User chooses vote
            - Client sends the vote and the public key to the server
        5. Validation
            - Server validates the public key by sending ZKP challenges
            - If validated, server adds vote and adds public key as voter
